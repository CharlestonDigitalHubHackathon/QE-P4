<h2>Shuttle Bay</h2>

<p>
    You enter what must be the Shuttle Bay â€“ a large bay with a wide opening at one end, large enough for a plane to fly through. You see earth through the opening, slowly receding into the blackness of space.
</p>
<p>
    A small, sleek spacecraft sits in the middle of the large bay, its door over door stands open, inviting you to climb aboard. To your left is a control panel with a large, glowing red button in its center. Behind you is a stairwell, leading down.
